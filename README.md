# AssassinationFiles.Net

[AssassinationFiles.Net](assassinationfiles.net) is a site I put together to brush up on some web skills.  I OCR'd 278k pages of declassified documents related to the JFK Assassination and full-text indexed them.  I don't have any specific interest in the event, but thought it would make for a decent project. 

The stack used was ImageMagick, tessearact, Apache Solr.
