# AssassinationFiles.Net

[AssassinationFiles.Net][] (RIP) is a site I put together to brush up on some web skills.  I OCR'd 366k pages of declassified documents related to the JFK Assassination and full-text indexed them.  I don't have any specific interest in the event, but thought it would make for a decent project. 

The stack used was ImageMagick, pdfbox, tessearact, Apache Solr.
